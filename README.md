Course name: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

Hint: I made this project to accomplish project1 portion of HarvardX CS50W course.

App name: wiki

Breif description: This is a wiki app made with django. Anyone can use this website features you have to login first. You can search for any subject that you whant to read about it, view it and edit it if thier is any wrong information at what you read, also you can create new subjects that you whant to write about to feed our site with your knowledge.

Technology used: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, PYTHON, Django

Hint: It would start to get tedious if every page on wiki had to be written in HTML. Instead, it can be helpful to store encyclopedia entries using a lighter-weight human-friendly markup language. Weâ€™ll store encyclopedia entries using a markup language called Markdown.

Requirements for this project:
After install python you need to install this modules just open cmd then run next two lines separated
python -m pip install Django
pip3 install markdown2
